## About
Price Tracker is a smart price monitoring tool built to help users catch the best deals on clothing. It automates the entire process â€” from scraping the product page to notifying you the moment a price changes.
## Key FeaturesðŸ”§
- **Real-Time Price Monitoring**: Tracks price fluctuations on AJIO product pages.
- **Email Alerts**: Automatically notifies you via email when a tracked item's price changes.
- **Scheduled Tracking**: Runs seamlessly every 10 minutes, so you never miss a price drop.
